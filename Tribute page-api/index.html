                <!-- <h4>Brief History and Origin of Cristiano Ronaldo</h4> -->
                <p>
                    <b>Cristiano Ronaldo dos Santos Aveiro</b>(born Feb. 5, 1985, Funchal, Madeira, Port.), Portuguese
                    football (soccer) player. While playing with Manchester United (2003–09), he developed into one of
                    the game’s best forwards, noted for his free-reined attacking style. In 2008 he helped United win a
                    Champions League title, and that year he also was named FIFA World Player of the Year. In 2009 he
                    joined Real Madrid. He won a second world player of the year award (renamed the FIFA Ballon d’Or)
                    after scoring 66 goals in 2013.
                </p>
                <br>
                <h4>Intro to Soccer</h4>
                <p>It was through his dad's work as an equipment manager at a boy's club that Ronaldo was first
                    introduced to the game of soccer. By the time he was 10 years old, he was already recognized as a
                    phenomenon—a kid who ate, slept and drank the game. "All he wanted to do as a boy was play
                    football," his godfather, Fernao Sousa, recalled for British reporters, adding, "He loved the game
                    so much he'd miss meals or escape out of his bedroom window with a ball when he was supposed to be
                    doing his homework."</br>
                    By his early teens, Ronaldo's talent and legend had grown considerably. After a stint with Nacional
                    da liha da Madeira, he signed with Sporting Portugal in 2001. That same year, at the tender age of
                    16, Ronaldo turned heads with a mesmerizing performance against Manchester United, wowing even his
                    opponents with his footwork and deft skill. He made such an impression that a number of United
                    players asked their manager to try and sign the young player. It wasn't long before the club paid
                    Ronaldo's team more than £12 million for his services - a record fee for a player of his age.</p>
                <br>
                <h4>Success with Manchester United</h4>
                <p>
                    Ronaldo did not disappoint the soccer world. He showed his promise early on in the 2004 FA Cup
                    final, scoring the team's first three goals and helping them capture the championship. In 2008, a
                    year after signing a five-year, £31 million contract, Ronaldo again justified his high salary when
                    he put together one of the club's finest seasons in history, setting a franchise record for goals
                    scored (42), and earning himself the FIFA World of the Year honor. In all, Ronaldo helped steer
                    Manchester United to three premier league titles. But Ronaldo's time in England was marred by his
                    mother's 2007 struggle with breast cancer as well as his father's death from alcohol-related
                    illness. The latter was especially hard for Ronaldo as the two had been close, and the young athlete
                    had often pushed for his father to enter rehab and address his drinking. His father, however, never
                    accepted the offer.

                <br>
                <h4>Real Madrid & National Victory</h4>
                <p>
                    As lauded as Ronaldo was on the field for Manchester United, his commitment to the club came under
                    constant question. Speculation swirled that he wanted to play elsewhere. So in 2009, when Spanish
                    soccer club Real Madrid agreed to pay United a record $131 million for the chance to sign him,
                    nobody was all that surprised to see Ronaldo leave United.
                    "I know that they are going to demand a lot of me to be successful at the club and I know that I'm
                    going to have much more pressure than at Manchester United because I was there for many years,"
                    Ronaldo told reporters. "But it means a new challenge and is going to help me be the best
                    footballer."
                    In addition to his FIFA World Player of the year award, Ronaldo has also won the coveted Ballon
                    d'OR, the Golden Boot, and been named the UEFA Club Forward of the Year, among other honors during
                    the course of his career.
                    On July 10, 2016, Ronaldo added another emotional victory to his accolades, leading Portugal to the
                    European Championship final against France as his national team's captain. Although he was sidelined
                    after suffering a knee injury 25 minutes into the match, Portugal went on to win the championship
                    title 1-0, their first international trophy. Ronaldo's teammates said that he motivated them as team
                    captain from the sidelines. "He gave us a lot of confidence and he said, 'Listen people, I'm sure we
                    will win this Euro so stay together and fight for it,’” full-back Cedric Soares said after
                    Portugal’s victory.
                    "This is one of the happiest moments in my career,” Ronaldo commented. ”I’ve always said I wanted to
                    win a trophy with the national team and make history. And I did it. Thank God, things went well for
                    us."
                    In January 2017, Ronaldo won FIFA's 2016 best player of the year for the fourth time, beating out
                    Lionel Messi. Ronaldo’s 2016 wins included the European Championship, Champions League, and Club
                    World Cup, plus individual awards from UEFA and France Football magazine, according to USA Today. In
                    his acceptance speech, Ronaldo said: "2016 was the best year of my career."
